    Parameters
    ----------
    sequence_container_type : Union[Type[list], Type[tuple]]
        Type of the sequence container; either a list or tuple.
    sequence_container
        Something that should in essence be a sequence container.
    type_mismatch_action : Literal['error', 'warning']
        What to do if `sequence_container` isn't a `sequence_container_type`. If
        'error', raises a TypeError. If 'warning', raises a UserWarning. Ignores type
        mismatches by default.
    value_on_cast_error : Tuple[Any, ...]
        Value to set `sequence_container` to if
        `sequence_container_type(sequence_container)` throws an Exception. By default,
        raises a TypeError.
    minimum_length : int
        The smallest length `sequence_container` can have. Defaults to no lower limit.
    maximum_length : int
        The largest value `sequence_container` can have. Defaults to no upper limit.
    length_is_multiple_of : Iterable[int]
        Natural numbers `sequence_container` length should be a multiple of. Ignores length factorization by default.
    length_violation_action: Literal['error', 'warning', 'truncate-and-pad']
        What to do if `sequence_container` length is not between `minimum_length` and
        `maximum_length`. If 'error', raises a ValueError. If 'warning', raises a
        UserWarning. If 'truncate-and-pad', will attempt to truncate or pad
        `sequence_container` to satisfy `minimum_length`, `maximum_length` and
        `length_is_multiple_of`. Ignores length violations by default.
    truncation_side : Literal["left", "right", "both-but-prioritize-left", "both-but-prioritize-right"]
        What side to truncate on. If 'left', will truncate from the left. If 'right',
        will truncate from the right. If 'both-but-prioritize-left', will truncate from
        both sides equally, giving priority to left-truncation. If
        'both-but-prioritize-right', will truncate from both sides equally, giving
        priority to right-truncation. Truncation is disabled by default.
    padding_side : Literal["left", "right", "both-but-prioritize-left", "both-but-prioritize-right"]
        What side to pad to. If 'left', will pad to the left. If 'right', will pad to
        the right. If 'both-but-prioritize-left', will pad to both sides equally, giving priority to left-padding. If 'both-but-prioritize-right', will pad to
        both sides equally, giving priority to right-padding. Padding is disabled by
        default.
    padding_value : Tuple[Any, ...]
        Value with which to pad. If value is shorter than the amount to pad it will be
        automatically repeated to fit the necessary length. By default, pad with None.
    warning_stack_level : int
        Stack level which to report for warnings. Defaults to 2 (whatever called this).

    -------
    Union[List[Any], Tuple[Any, ...]]
